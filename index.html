            <p class="no-margin">Hi. I'm Danny, a nerd in his late twenties.</p>
            <p>I've been selling software as my main and only source of income for a little over 10 years now. According to some I've never had a "real" job, but I know that my work is as real as it gets.</p>
            <p>It started out with me being hospitalized in Vietnam and thus having some computer time. I used that time to build <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress</a>, which is now in use on well over 1 million websites.</p>
            <p>More products followed while I worked from warmer parts of the world for a few years. These days, I am usually working from home in The Netherlands while trying to be a father for my 2 daughters.</p>
            <p>I am <a href="{{site.url}}/now">currently working</a> on <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>: a privacy-friendly analytics plugin for WordPress.</p>
