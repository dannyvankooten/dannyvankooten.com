Last Friday was a day of many milestones [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com), which is by far my biggest WordPress plugin.

The plugin experienced some crazy growth since its first release, less than 2 years ago.


#### 1.000.000 downloads
At _exactly midnight UTC_ the plugin was downloaded for the **millionth time**.

Wow.

In retrospect, just a little over a year ago [the plugin was still at 100.000 downloads](https://dannyvankooten.com/100-000-plugin-downloads-6-months-Mailchimp-wordpress/). 

#### 10.000+ downloads in 24 hours

While this is mostly due to people updating the plugin to the latest version, it is certainly a milestone I looked forward to.

Last Friday, the plugin was downloaded a staggering 12.000 times.

#### 20 most popular plugins of all-time
Not sure how long this has been the case but Mailchimp for WordPress is now featured on the ["Most Popular" plugins sidebar on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) as #17.

#### More numbers

We did a post on the [Mailchimp for WordPress Blog listing some numbers on the plugin](https://www.mc4wp.com/blog/one-million-downloads/).

I'm delighted to have reached those milestones and eager to continue this amazing journey.

A huge **thank  you** to all  plugin users for making this possible!
