I am looking for people to help me out handling email support for the various products I build, most noticeably [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/) at the moment. I have various other plugins in the making so support is at a continuously improving load.

### What I need from you..

While getting along well is very important to me, I do have some other requirements.
 
- Good English writing skills
- Experience in supporting WordPress users
- You don't need to be a full-fletched developer but having _some_ knowledge about HTML, CSS and WP development is a huge plus.
- Having played with Mailchimp for WordPress (free or paid) before would be cool.
- Responsibility. When working with me you'll be _very free_ in how exactly and when you do work.

### What I offer..

- A decent salary
- Flexible work times
- The ability to work from wherever you like
- A behind the scenes look into developing & marketing WordPress plugins.
